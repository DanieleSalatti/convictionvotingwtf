            Conviction Voting is a decision making process in which voters continuously express their preference by staking tokens in support of proposals they would like to see approved,
            with the conviction (i.e. weight) of their vote growing over time.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl">
            When a voter unstakes their tokens, their conviction for that proposal starts declining according to a decay function.
